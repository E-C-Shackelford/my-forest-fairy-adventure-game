# my-forest-fairy-adventure-game

In this Python project, I created a text-based adventure game, as part of my Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree final projects. 
My Python adventure game prints a description of what's happening in the game.
My game asks the user to choose a left or right path when they reach a crossroad.
Depending on which path the user chooses to take, the user will either come across one of the villans (randomly selected each round the game is played) or magical forest fairies.
The user wins or loses the game depending on the actions they select.
After the game has ended, the user is able to choose whether or not they would like to play another round of the game.
